- Follow existing code style and patterns
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions

#### React Components
- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components focused and reusable
- Use proper TypeScript props interfaces
- Follow the existing file structure

#### CSS/Styling
- Use Tailwind CSS classes
- Follow the existing design system
- Ensure responsive design
- Test on different screen sizes
